 [color=black][center] Dimension Traveller's note[/center]
Hello, if you have this paper, then that means you're probably somewhere you shouldn't be.
And additionally, you are taking a maths test. Now, this is very important: maths is not how you know it!
You're in a different dimension, so no duh it'll be different, anyways I'll skip that stuff, here's the rundown:

	+ = *
	- = /
	/ = -
	* = +
	
	Order of operations: PASMD
	
	When in doubt, go D
	
	Also, if you ever see a ticker on one of the pages, make sure to get rid of them. Time seems to move faster when they're around.

	Finally, function on the assumption that nothing is the same, luckily, if you have this page then you're taking an open book test!
So you should have all the materials necessary to deduce the answers to these questions.







P.S. If you get every question right, you get to go back. Why do I know this? Well, why do you think I gave you this paper? And why do you think you're here in the first place?
